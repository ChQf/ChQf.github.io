I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/){:target="_blank"} ([Research Centre for Grid Modernisation](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/rcgm/?sc_lang=en){:target="_blank"} and [RISA research lab](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ee/siqibu/index.html){:target="_blank"}) in 2025.
I received my M.Eng. degree in Power System & Automation and B.Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering & Automation both from [Fuzhou University](https://dqxy.fzu.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}, China, in 2021 and 2018, respectively. I used to be a visiting Ph.D. student at National University of Singapore in 2024.
<br>My current research interests include:
{: .text-justify}
* **power system stability analysis and control**
<br>1. stability risk analysis and control considering uncertainties;
<br>2. power electronic-dominated power system stability based on impedance modeling and analysis;
* **data analysis for smart grid**
<br>1. data-driven power system stability assessment;
<br>2. trustworthy artificial intelligence theory and methods for power systems;
<br>3. data-driven uncertainty modeling and analysis.

Please feel free to contact me for further exchanges and cooperation (email is preferred).
