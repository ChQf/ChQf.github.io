Currently, I am a postgraduate student majoring in Power Systems & Automation with College of Electrical Engineering & Automation, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China.
I received my B.Eng degree in Electrical Engineering & Automation from Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China, in 2018.
Then, I was recommended for admission to be a postgraduate without exams.
My current research interests are **application of big data/machine learning in power system (evaluation, prediction and optimization)**.
In my undergraduate period, I was committed to participating in robotics competitions, in which I combined MCU with sensors to control robot behaviors.
